## How it's work?
This game is played between two players. You can start by finding a random player. If someone searched subsequently after you searched, you both are connected or vice-versa and after connection his/her name will be shown on top-right corner, then you need to fill up squares with blue color as fast as possible. For each win you will get +5 Points. The person with the most covered cells at the end of game will then be crowned as the winner!

The result for each match will be published by Chat Bot with top 10 Ranks in Leaderboard chat, also user can group chat.
